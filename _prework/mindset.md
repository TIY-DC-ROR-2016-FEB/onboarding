## Mindset

1. Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
2. Read [What is Code](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
3. __Compose an email to [me](mailto:{{ site.instructor_email }}) answering the following questions:__
  - What aspects of the Growth and Fixed mindset can you identify in your personal history? In what areas do you feel Fixed? Where do you see the most Growth?
  - What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?
  - What excited and surprised you in What is Code? Was the description of programming (both the activity and the culture) what you expected? How did it differ?
