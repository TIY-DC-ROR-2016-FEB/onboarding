## Accounts You'll Need

Over the course of the class, we'll be using a number of online services.  We'll
set up a few of them for you, but these are the ones you'll need to register for
on your own. Please use the __same email address__ to register that you provided
to {{ site.cd_name_informal }} for communications.

* [Github](https://github.com/) - Add a profile picture and your full name
* [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity)
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

You may have heard that we also use the following tools, but don't sign up for them yet; we'll do that once you get here:

* Slack
* Trello

__Compose an email to [me](mailto:{{ site.instructor_email }}) answering the following questions:__

  1. What is your GitHub username?
  1. Did you upload a picture to your GitHub account to help me learn faces?
  1. What aspects of the Growth and Fixed mindset can you identify in your personal history? In what areas do you feel Fixed? Where do you see the most Growth?
  1. The third article was short, and was about recent research in learning styles. What is your gut reaction about the findings and about their plausibility? Would you have said that you were a visual, an auditory, or a tactile learner?
  1. What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?
  1. What excited and surprised you in What is Code? Was the description of programming (both the activity and the culture) what you expected? How did it differ?
